                    <p>I studied at the best school in our city – Gymnasium No. 1 (Partner School of the Russian Academy of Sciences). 
                        In addition to it, from 2022 to 2024, in order to obtain the Canadian Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD), 
                        I have been studying in a joint online academic credit program between Red Leaf Group and Ontario e-School called “Edualia” 
                        in the Engineering and Architecture Stream program.<br>

                        During the education process, I gained useful experience in teamwork while creating the project 
                        “Unmanned aerial vehicle for observing animals in the wild.” At that time, I was responsible for creating project drawings 
                        and mastered computer drawing skills. I also successfully completed online courses in the field of Frontend developer and I have 
                        gained my skills in designing websites. In addition, in order to successfully pass exams at the Gymnasium and receive a gold medal 
                        “For exceptional academic achievements,” I took paid online courses in computer science.
                        <br>
                        Currently studying at Humber Polytechnic on Computer Programming and Analysis program. I hope that by studying here I will be able to gain advanced academic knowledge,
                         as well as develop innovative thinking, and gain practical skills in applying my knowledge.</p>
                    <p>
                        Due to good education, I have quite a lot of skills in different areas. I am sure that I am able to apply 
                        these skills well due to my determination and some other personal qualities, such as patience and responsibility, for example.
